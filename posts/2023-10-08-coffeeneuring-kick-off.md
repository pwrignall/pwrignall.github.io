In a Discord which I'm a member of, someone posted a link to the [2023 Coffeeneuring Challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2023/09/24/coffeeneuring-challenge-2023-lucky-13/). It tickled my interest.

## The challenge

From the site, "If you ride a bike, drink coffee or tea (or even hot chocolate, coffee stouts, or cider), and enjoy low-key adventures please consider this fall endeavor." All of these things appeal to me, so I considered it! In short:

> - between October 7 through November 20, 2023,
> - ride your bike to 7 places,
> - at least 2 miles round trip each time,
> - drink 7 total cups of coffee (or another fall-type beverage), and
> - document your coffeeneuring (either photos, Strava tracks, journal entries, control card, etc.) in case the Coffeeneuring Challenge Committee and the Intern (yes, the Intern is back!) ever conducts an audit.

Having taken some time off exercise after the peak of the summer, it seemed an achievable, enjoyable way to get back into some regular activities and a good opportunity to explore the area around me.

### Today's ride

This won't be breaking any records anytime soon &mdash; I'm not even sure the calorie burn matched the cake intake &mdash; but on an unseasonably warm October day with temperatures at around 20&deg;C it was a fantastic way to spend an hour and a bit out of the house.

My mid-ride destination was **[The Archive](https://thearchive.works/pages/info)**, a great cycling clubhouse which served a very good cappuccino and an excellent coffee and walnut cake.

## Enter the Campachoochoo Chronicles

Since one of the requirements of the challenge is to "document your coffeeneuring", and I've wanted to set up an online space for writing about this kind of thing &mdash; and more &mdash; I took it as a sign to get this done.

I'm planning to include the rest of my coffeeneuring exploits as well as: noting things I've found interesting that I want to find again later, sharing (hopefully) useful bits of information that aren't easy to find elsewhere, and getting better at writing.

The "campachoochoo" part of the name is courtesy of Bob Mortimer and one of his ['Train Guy' catchphrases](https://mashable.com/article/bob-mortimer-train-guy). No affiliation with it, I just like the word!

Thanks to Mendhak's [Eleventy Satisfactory Blog Theme](https://github.com/mendhak/eleventy-satisfactory) and its excellent documentation to help get me going.
